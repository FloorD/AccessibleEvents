# CONTRIBUTING

## How To Contribute
If you are the owner, a contributor, member of staff or attendee (in-person or remote) of an event, please contribute by dropping ideas for increasing accessibility into the respective RAW COLLECTION OF IDEAS of the categorized event. When these ideas have been tried out by event orgas, staff and/or attendees, they are being validated and rated in the IN TESTING collection. After a successful proof of concept (>x attendees/staff members/orgas attest positively), the idea becomes a best practice and is listed in ACCESSIBILITY GUIDANCE of an event category.

### RAW COLLECTION OF IDEAS
Use markdown and describe your idea in a few sentences considering the following things:
NAME it uniqely in this document.
WHAT barrier is being removed or lowered? WHO benefits?
WHAT needs to be done?
WHICH tools are getting used?
WHO has to commit to it?

Example: 
NAME: Implement video streaming for remote attendees.
BENEFICARIES: People who can't make it in-person are still able to see the session. Beneficial for mobility impaired folks, sick people, people interested but not in a distance to travel.
TODO: Set up camera, use wifi on site, use a streaming service, make people aware of recording in progress, get speakers ok for being streamed, set up audio to be captured into stream (additional microphone).
TOOLS: Teams Meeting
RESPONSIBILITIES: Meetup Owner, volunteers

### ACCESSIBILITY GUIDANCE

Further occurrences and ratings may be applied and the list gets sorted by the rating with highest rated items first.
