# Accessible Events

## Background
How to extend and transform events to happen online, in parts or entirely, and provide a maximum of accessibibility to attendees, online and on-site? This repo is intended as a knowledge base to help organisers make their events more accessible. It was started in times of COVID-19/coronavirus (March 2020), when many events were struggling with in-person participation and got cancelled due to the risk of infection and further spread of the virus. Nevertheless, this time of crisis is also an opportunity to make in-person events more accessible to remote attendees (digitally live) and post-event consumption (digitally on-demand) of content.

## How To Contribute
If you are the owner, a contributor, member of staff or attendee (in-person or remote) of an event, please contribute by dropping ideas for increasing accessibility into the respective RAW COLLECTION OF IDEAS of the categorized event. 
When these ideas have been tried out by event orgas, staff and/or attendees, they are being validated and rated in the IN TESTING collection. After a successful proof of concept (>x attendees/staff members/orgas attest positively), the idea becomes a best practice and is listed in ACCESSIBILITY GUIDANCE of an event category.

## Main Categorization
### Small In-Person Events (<50 attendees)
Classic regional niche meetups.
Characteristics: Typically 2-3, sometimes 4 in-person speakers. Speaking slots are between 20 minutes and 1h. Venues are often chosen by availability. Presentation / live demos / video playback through laptop of presenter on projection wall or large display(s). Audio and display connectors vary, as room equipment allows. Seating options vary between theater style to workshop tables. Seldom grouped tables.

## Definitions

### Events
This collection of practices focuses mainly on tech community events, like conferences, user group meetings, sprints, meetups et al. When using the term "event", we refer to this type of events that are most common in the tech industry.

### Accessibility
Removing barriers for each and every individual to participate without the need to ask for support.

### Online
Happening in the digital space. For content, online can be both live and on-demand.

### On-Site
Being physically present on the venue and during the event.

### Remote / Off-Site
Opposite to On-Site, remote is everyone who is not physically present.

### Content
Content can be a talk or a session, a slidedeck, a recording or video, audio, a transcript. A conversation between attendees or speakers / staff and attendees is generally not considered content, although it can contain meaningful things. <3
